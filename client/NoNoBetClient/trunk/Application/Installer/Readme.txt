Howe to create a new NoNoBetClient installer:
1. Build a new Realease version of the NoNoBetClient ("Rebuild Solution" in Solution Explorer menu).
   Make sure "Release" mode is selected in Solution Configuration
2. Open the Installer folder in Windows Explorer
3. Compile the InstallNoNoBetClient.nsi script file ("Compile NSIS Script" in file menu)
   Note: You must have NSIS installed on your machine.
4. A installer named "InstallNoNoBetClient.exe" should now have been created.
