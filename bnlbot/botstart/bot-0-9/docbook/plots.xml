    <title>The Plots</title>
    <para>
      The plots are presented in powerdays order,
      where powerday is simply a power and a range of days. 
      The plots has 4 curves, the oranges is the untouched/pristine. This is what would happen if we betted 
      as the betrules are, all the time, no care taken for daily profit or loss.
      The green one honors the daliy profit and losses.
      The red is the history lines, which is where the powerdays come into play.
      Given a number of days in the past, we summarize the profit for that day
      and divide it with how many days ago it was. So 107 means power of 1, for 7 days.
      S7/7 + S6/6 ... S1/1 where 1 was yesterday. The power factor comes into play in the denominator.
      328 means S28/cubicroot(28) + S27/cubicroot(27) ... S1/cubicroot(1).       
      221 means S21/squareroot(21) + S20/squareroot(20) ... S1/squareroot(1). 
      
      If this sum >= 0.0 then we bet honoring both history and daily profit and loss, and this is the blue curve.
