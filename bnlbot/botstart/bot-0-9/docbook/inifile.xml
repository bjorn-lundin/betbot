    <para>
      This document presents selected results from the bot beeing feed by a market fetcher simulator.
      The bot is running with the same logic as if it was the real thing.
      It is feed a marketid, and it picks it up from the database, making business decisons.
      These decisions are mainly configurd in <filename>betfair.ini</filename>
      which is located in the user's home directoty within the betbot file system
    </para>
    <para>
    A snippet from the file may look like
      <programlisting>
[HORSES_PLC_LAY4_IE]
enabled=true
bet_size=30.0
dry_run=True
max_daily_profit=100000.0
max_daily_loss=-250
allow_in_play=False
countries=IE
allowed_days=mo,tu,we,fr,su
no_of_winners=3
min_num_runners=7
max_num_runners=25
      </programlisting>
    The bot will figure out that this is a lay4 bet on horses in the place markets in
    Ireland from the section name.
    The rest is kind of self explanatory.
    </para>
    <para>
    However, for lay bets there are
      <programlisting>
max_lay_price=90.0
min_lay_price=10.0
lay_exit_early=True
      </programlisting>
      Meaning we make a lay bet on the first runner that has
        10 &lt;= lay-price &lt;= 90.
      Also, hardcoded in the program, there must be 7 horses better rated
      by the back-price, than this one.
      lay_exit_early may be false, which gets a horse with lay-price closer to 90.
      If lay_exit_early is true, we get a runner closer to 10.
    </para>
    <para>
      For back bets there are instead
      <programlisting>
back_price=6.5
delta_price=0.3
     </programlisting>
     which make back bets on runners with back price 6.5 +- 0.3,
     ie  6.0 &lt;0= back-price &lt;= 6.8
    </para>
